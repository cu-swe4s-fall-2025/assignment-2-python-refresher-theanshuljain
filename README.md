The get_column function definition in the my_utils.py file helps us choose specific columns from any dataset and analyze the columns of choice. The print_fires.py file actually utilizes the get_column function from the my_utils.py file and gives us analysis about the forest fires in United States of America. The get_columns function is written in a way that defaults the results_column argument to have cleaner code and get whatever results we want based on the assignment. The run.sh file runs the print_fires.py file.
